## 🧠 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Gesture-Controlled Robotic System** — a futuristic web-based interface where you control actions using nothing but your **hand gestures**! This project captures live hand movements through your webcam, interprets them using AI, and maps them to actions, creating a smart and intuitive control system.

## ✨ Features

- ✋ Real-time **hand gesture detection**
- 🖥️ **Webcam-based** control system (no extra hardware needed)
- ⚡ Smooth, responsive controls powered by **MediaPipe**
- 🎮 Can be used to **simulate robotic actions**, control devices, or trigger events
- 🧪 Clean UI with a futuristic robotic vibe
- 🔊 Future-ready for integration with **IoT / real hardware**
